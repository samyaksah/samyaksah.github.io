        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>This was a course project that lasted for 2 months wherein we were tasked to learn about Videography principles and apply them to create a short film. The story is about a university student named Nat who finds a small hole in her wall, that she later finds out, lets her see her future. Her attempt to rewrite her impending doom causes her to go in a state of Paranoia.</p>

          <h4>Pre Production</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>Before starting we needed to figure out what each of us brought to the table. Since I feel comfortable in a leadership role, I took on the role as the co-director, editor and cinematographer. I also planned to assist in most of the coordination, delegation and ideation of the work. As for the story, we decided to create a plot that is interesting and shows each of our strengths properly. We realise that you can never do single shoot and expect it to be perfect which is why we wanted to be efficient with our story that would allow us more time for re-shoots and more chances to iterate. This why our story is located in one single house and consists of just one character. But this did not mean that we were compromising with our story. We intended to make a thriller/horror film that catches the audience’s attention.  Next, we created a script and I also managed to get an actor that fir perfect for our role. </p>

          <h4>Production</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>I was majorly involved with in the production of the film, from adjusting lighting to shooting the whole film. I coordinated with our team mate who was in-charge of sound engineering to record soundscapes that would work well with our shots. While working as a cinematographer, it was important for me to follow certain rules of cinematography such as the 180-degree rule, rule of thirds, golden ratio, eye level framing etc. As expected, we were not happy with the rough cut from our first session of shoot. And after our helpful critique session with our professor, we figured out the exact problem which made our next rough cut much more better. </p>

          <h4>Post Production</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>As the film’s editor, I was responsible for the major choices of the flow and pacing of the film. The first step was to go through the usable footage and compile them in adobe premiere. It was then I created a few rough cuts to demonstrate some possibilities of how the film would flow and decide the pacing of the video. After a long and arduous chat with the team and making sure that everyone’s decisions were integrated in the final rough draft. After we were happy with our final draft it was time to sit down and work on the finer details of film. I color corrected the video and made sure that the pacing made sense throughout the video. I then passed on the video to our sound engineer to make sure that the diegetic and non diegetic sounds (Foley) worked well with the final cut. </p>

        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>The final video was something that my team and I were certainly happy about. Our satisfaction with our work was complimented by the “Best Story” award and nominations for “Best VFX”, “Best Human in a Leading Role”, “Best Drama” and “People’s Choice Award”. Additionally, I honed my skills in a leadership role, as a camera man, director and an editor. The film also a first step towards me realising how much I want to go into Narrative design and editing. Overall I am really happy with the result from this project.</p>
