        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>Idagio is a classical music streaming service founded with the intent of creating a streaming experience tailored to the needs of classical music listeners. In doing so, they aim to establish themselves as the home for classical music, and in turn, secure the future of the genre with their platform. However Idagio currently expects its listeners to solely use their service as a means of discovering classical music and disregard their preferred existing method of discovery being online resourses like reddit and blogposts</p>

        <p>Our solution brings Idagio to the listenersâ€™ preferred mode of classical music discovery (r/classicalmusic, talk-classical etc.) by providing tools that assist them to ease and centralize the music discovery experience. This was a 5 weeks long experience design project where-in we discovered a point of intervention to improve the classical music listening experience on Idagio.</p>

                  <p>As compared to a genre like Pop that requires the name of the song or at most the name of the artist, classical music requires much more to be able to find exact music a listener is looking for. Due to classical music's unique naming convention <mark>(Symphony No. 1 in C Major, Op. 21: I. Adagio molto â€“ Allegro con brio)</mark>, as well as the desires of classical music listeners, the genre is not currently hosted suitably by leading resources for music such as Spotify or YouTube. Spotify.</p>
                  <p>Idagio are not the only ones to recognize this, with indication of many listeners seeking a streaming service tailored to these attributes, and Primephonic (a notable competitor) being acquired by Apple.</p>

                <h4>Problem with IDAGIO</h4>
              </div>
              <p>Idagio has identified the majority of their audience to include established classical music listeners, yet acknowledges a necessity to appeal to prospective listeners in order to achieve their goal of securing the future of the classical music genre. Through our own research, we have identified a notable quantity of inquiries regarding classical music, and reviewed studies indicating a prevalent willingness of prospective listeners to learn about the genre. Therefore, it would seem that Idagio's audience exists of both established classical music fans, as well as curious newcomers.</p>

            <div class="section-image">
              <img src="img/sliding scale.png" alt="sample-image">
            </div>

            <p>Taking into account this sliding scale of knowledge, we proposed an extension of their service designed for fluctuation, rather than extremes. Our method of doing so relies on the use of veteran knowledge and desire to engage in discussion as learning resources for newcomers through the use of a discussion board like platform.</p>

              <p>Based on the feedback we received, we acknowledged a necessity to differentiate from similar services such as Reddit, Medium, or SoundCloud to secure an audience. Initially, iterated on this proposal with the intention of finding what a substantial differentiator may be. However, we soon realized that there was a greater underlying problem: <mark>we were asking all participants and readers of classical music discussion to shift their venue to us, when many are existing comfortably where they are.</mark> Simply put, this demand was already being met.</p>

              <p>Our coming proposal to this problem, were guided by additional insight gathered by presenting these classical music communities with a survey. This survey reinforced that even listeners who believe their knowledge of classical music to be sophisticated desire to learn more, and that they do so from home through online resources, likely due to an indicated desire to discuss and share classical music.</p>

                <p>With these new insights, we discovered that rather than try to own the discussion, asking listeners to migrate to IDAGIO, we should bring IDAGIO to the listeners in their own venues of discussion. By doing so, we intend to support an already-existing method of discovery, used by both newcomers and veterans, rather than force listeners to adapt to any IDAGIO-facilitated methods.</p>

              <p>The idea behind our adapted proposal is to leverage established venues for discussion by providing flexible, discovery-supporting tools which reinforce IDAGIO as the home for classical music throughout various locations. These would take the form of a convenient embed designed for sharing classical music, and an extension which supports it. These discovery tools would then be reinforced through an in-app recap, intended to further support exploration and collection of music discovered through online rabbit-holing</p>
