        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>Created by Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen in the late 1960s, the Theory of Reasoned Action states that a consumer only takes a specific action when there is an equally specific result expected. From the time the consumer decides to act to the time the action is completed, the consumer retains the ability to change his or her mind and decide on a different course of action.  <br> We as a team found that some businesses are finding it harder to promote their products as users want to be validated in their purchases before they actually buy it. These businesses tend to be in the area where customers historically can only go in-store to buy the products that would fit their preferences, like the jewelry, nails, or clothing industry. Our focus on the nail industry was backed up by our initial research where nail enthusiasts felt that drop-in appointment wait times are too long, with no clear catalog of options, or an overwhelming amount of customization choices and not a lot of time to choose. </p>

            <p>From an in-depth analysis of the interviews, we noticed that customers were overwhelmed when selecting a color on the spot from a catalog of hundreds of colors.

            <p>While the cognitive overload when selecting a color was one of their major concerns, they also had issues with the trustworthiness of the salon itself.

        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>In Neilson/norman group’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, one of the principles is about matching the system with the real world. Since we wanted our app to co-exist with other photo/video editing apps that people generally use, I turned to apps like Snapseed and VSCO for inspiration. Snapseed’s tools dock design is clean and can fit quite a number of tools and filters in it, which inspired me to implement that in our app. Similarly, we took inspiration from Snapchat for the UI of our AR Feature. Users can swipe left and right to select nail designs that have been saved in the catalog previously.</p>

          <p>Pinterest has a handy tap and hold interaction that can be used to save, share and hide pins. Because of how it decreases clutter on the screen, I used this interaction for our app where users could select which finger they want to apply the color on. This worked well in the context of our app by decreasing color and increasing how quickly users can make a selection.</p>

          <h4>Low Fidelity tests, iterations and it’s challenges</h4>

        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>I was responsible for creating the first draft of the prototype which we as a team could iterate on. I started with creating a basic interface on Adobe XD for all the features of the app factoring in the insights from the user studies. This app puts the user on the front seat when it comes to customizing their nails which interactions like drag, zoom pinch.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>While creating prototypes for the app, one major challenge we faced was finding the right prototyping tool that could support the animation we wanted for our app’s customization tools to do. We initially used Adobe XD which supported simple transitions but could not fully translate the customization tool’s ability during some user testing. I then set out to create a much more interactive prototype on Axure to conduct a more fruitful user testing session with our target audience.</p>

          <p>Another team member and I conducted several user testing sessions and were able to find some user experience and efficiency issues. We knew the limitations of the prototype which is why we were more interested in their reactions on the quality of the iconography, our use of skeuomorphism to make the tool dock intuitive, the salon finder and the overall enjoyment of the app.</p>

        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>We understood the limitation of creating a robust, refined and interactive mockup on prototyping softwares like Figma and Axure. We were also restricted in creating a working prototype for the AR feature due to the fact that no one in the team was efficient with coding for AR. But we still wanted to see what our design would look like, which is why I took the responsibility to create a proof of concept with After effects.</p>

          <h4>More Research and More Users tests</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>With almost over 56,300 individual nail salons and annual revenue of $5.29bn USD, the nail industry is booming. Our app proposal, although limited in its scope, can help organize the chaos that every nail enthusiast goes through when they want to get their nails done. With this app, we wanted to open paths to several other retail avenues where AR could be used to make users’ lives easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>If given more time to iterate, I believe it’s important for our team to conduct more user interviews with salon owners to get their insights and create an app that both stakeholders (customers and salon owners) can enjoy.</p>
