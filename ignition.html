          <h4>Project Context</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>This was a course project that lasted for 2 months wherein we were tasked to learn about 3D Animation principles and apply them using Autodesk Maya to make a short film. My team and I were really interested in Mixed Reality and the possibilties that come with it, so, we decided to mix real life footage and 3D animation to make a story that tells a story of a average man with a dull life who get trasnported to a Virtual world and has to take part in a action packed race that with another car. </p>

          <h4>Pre Production</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>Before we start anything, we had to come up with an idea that we could then develop, I was really inspired by the movie “Ready Player One” and their implementation of virtual reality, we decided to do something like that for our project too. I also liked the character design for the game “SUPER HOT”  which I though would fit well with the theme of racing and fast paced animation. We liked the idea of making something like a trailer for a virtual reality car racing game using both real life and 3D videography to convey our idea across.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We then decided to work on the environment (city, cars, and the human avatar) and also make the storyboard. Shuhan and Vivian started working on the cars, while Sinead was workshopping the avatar, and I was working on the story and how it would progress while also prototyping all the elements in Maya. Finally, I created the animatic using the rough models for our project which gave us an idea of what went well and what needs to be changed.</p>

          <h4>Production</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>After the animatic, we started working on the final modeling of the city, cars and the avatar While Shuhan and Vivian got the cars from Turbosquid and were tweaking the model to fit our project, Sinead and I were working on making the city and its layout. At the same time, I was also working on the Avatar and its texturing. I also shot and edited the real-life scene with an actor to go with the 3D animation.</p>
          <br>
          <p>After they were finished tweaking the cars, I rigged both the cars and the human so that its easier to animate, as well as added controls on the front axle to allow the front tires to rotate using set key function. I textured the environment, cars and the human according to the project. While I was animating all the scenes according to the story, Sinead was rendering the already animated scenes on multiple computers and making sure that all the files were stored in a proper way for us to begin the with compositing. </p>

          <h4>Post Production</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>After all the scenes were rendered, I started compositing all the scenes in Premiere. Then, after the rough cut was done, Sinead and I sat down and added VFX and sound in after effects. The rough part in this process was to make sure that the pacing of the music syncs well with the composited video. The video is meant to be a action packed car race which meant that the cuts in the video should also be fast paced. </p>

        <div class="section-copy">
          <p>Overall I am very happy with the result we got and what I learned. Because this is the course that made me realise that I wanted to make 3D Animation my career. And I think if I were to take this course again, I would make a much more polished game with intricate models, complex and realistic shaders.</p>
